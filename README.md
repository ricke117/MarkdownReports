This repo houses an app development project to generate parameterized reports for use by ecological risk assessors and others.

Ultimately, the app will allow users to wrangle diverse environmental data sets into a common format (based on the EPA's ProUCL software), summarize the data into tables, plots, and potentially maps, which will populate an automatically rendered Word document.

Throughout, the app will allow users to export intermediate products, which may be reformatted upon export into native Office spreadsheets and charts.
